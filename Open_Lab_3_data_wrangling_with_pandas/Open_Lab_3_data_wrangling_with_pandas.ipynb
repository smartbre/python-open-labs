    "With this Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook open, click the \"Copy to Drive\" button that appears in the menu bar. The notebook will then be attached to your own user account, so you can edit it in any way you like -- you can even take notes directly in the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Open lab time**: After the guided portion of the Open Lab, the rest of the time is for you to ask questions, work collaboratively, or have self-guided practice time. You will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.\n",
